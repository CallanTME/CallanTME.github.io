### Budget Confocal Microscope

An open source project with the aim to make costly confocal microscopy accessible to all. By using off the shelf parts and custom 3D printed pieces I created a highly replicable confocal microscope unit for Â£1500. 

A full report on the project is available here: [Report](https://github.com/CallanTME/LowCostConfocal/files/8895100/LowCostConfocal.Report.pdf)

An open-source repository with all the CAD files, BOM and build instructions is available here: [Repository](https://github.com/CallanTME/LowCostConfocal)
