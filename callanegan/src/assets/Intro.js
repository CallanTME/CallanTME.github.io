    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am a graduate biomedical engineer with deep interest in the medical
      device industry and technology. I have graduated from Imperial College
      London with a First-Class Honours. I have picked up a huge amount of
      experience from my work both inside and outside college. I have lead and
      contributed to many projects, some of which are showcased below. I have a
      highly varied skillset and am a very quick learner. This alongside my
      strong work ethic means that I am equipped to overcome whatever task is
      presented to me.
